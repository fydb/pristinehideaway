                The name "Maldives" means garland or necklace of islands. It is also known as the pearls of the Indian Ocean. Totaling over 1190 islands scattered over 90,000 sq kilometers in the middle of Indian ocean, they group in ring like formations and look like necklaces or garlands from the air.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every resort in the Maldives is its own private island, and with over 100 to choose from the only problem is selecting where to stay. At the top end, the world’s most exclusive hotel brands compete with each other to attain ever-greater heights of luxury, from personal butlers and private lap pools to in-room massages and pillow menus. But there’s choice beyond the five- and six-star resorts. Other islands cater for families, for divers, for those on a (relative) budget, and anyone wanting a tranquil back-to-nature experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                With some of the best diving and snorkeling in the world, the clear waters of the Maldives are a magnet for anyone with an interest in marine life. The richness and variety is astonishing – baby sharks can be spotted in any lagoon in the country, while dazzling spectacles such as huge coral walls, magnificent caves and schools of brightly coloured tropical fish await you when you get down to the reef. Manta rays, turtles, friendly sharks and even the world’s largest fish, the whale shark, can be seen all over the country and – amazingly – none of the life on the reef is dangerous. The best bit? The water is so warm many people don’t even wear a wetsuit.

              <h4 class="caps">Location and Geography</h4>
              <p>
                The Maldives lies in two rows of atolls in the Indian Ocean, just across the equator. Maldives has an area of less than 300 square kilometers and a total coastline of 644 kilometers. It’s located about 700 kilometers southwest of Sri Lanka and 400 kilometers southwest of India. Maldives is the smallest Asian country in both population and land area. With an average ground level of 1.5 meters (4 ft. 11 in) above sea level, it is the planet's lowest country.
              </p>
              <p>
                The country is made up of 1,190 coral islands formed around 26 natural ring-like atolls, spread over 90,000 square kilometers. These atolls structures are formed upon a sharp ridge rising from the ocean, making way for their secluded uniqueness. Ring-shaped reef structures form the atolls and these reefs provide the natural defense against wind and wave action on these delicate islands.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col s12 l6">
              <h4 class="caps">Weather and climate</h4>
              <p>
                The weather in the Maldives is usually picture perfect: sunlit days, breezy nights, balmy mornings, and iridescent sunsets. For a long time Maldivians have organized their lives based on a system on nakaiy. Each nakaiy is 13 or 14 days long and is divided into two seasons; iruvai northeast monsoon (December to April) and hulhangu south west monsoon (May to November). The nakaiy calendar is still used to determine such things as the best time for fishing, travel or planting crops.
              </p>
              <p>
                The northeast monsoon does not attract the same degree of cloud over or rainfall as the southwest monsoon and the occasional afternoon shower will not detract from your enjoyment of the islands. Severe monsoon storms are very rare. Throughout the year daytime temperatures are around the mid 20’s degrees Celsius. Night temperatures are pleasantly warm, although sea breezes can be quite cool. The hottest month is April and the coldest is December. Average temperature is around 29 - 32 degrees Celsius.

                    <p>The Maldives has become one of the world’s premier scuba diving destinations, because of the abundance of amazing white sand beaches, coral reefs, clear warm waters, many scuba diving sites and rich marine life.

                    <p>
                    Most holiday resorts in the Maldives have a scuba diving facility and there are a number of liveaboard operators offering scuba diving cruise holidays that take guests to many dive sites all over the Maldives. Many scuba divers are keen to dive in the Maldives because of the presence of whale sharks, manta rays, eagle rays, reef sharks, hammerhead sharks and moray eels, as well as many smaller fish and coral species.

Some centres offer courses for beginners and advances windsurfers and sailors. You could also chose to parasail, kayak, kite-surf, water-ski, and jet-ski.

                      The best way to experience the life of an ordinary Maldivian is to travel to an inhabited island. Some of these islands are slightly more modern: with brightly painted house walls and harbour areas. There are also the quite fishing villages with lots of tree-shade, swings, and the traditional wooden holhuashi. A holhuashi is rather like an island-version of a gazebo, build with hollow wooden trunks tied together forming the large, bench-like seat, and often with a thatched roof. They are conveniently set up on beaches, often where the boats come in, and is a place where islanders wind off after a day’s work, exchanging news, telling stories, playing cards, and listening to local radio.
